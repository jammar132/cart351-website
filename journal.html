      <h4>WEEK 1: September 8th</h4>
      <article>
        <!-- replace this with your own reflection -->
        - Introduced the course structure, objectives, and expectations. went over the course outline, departmental fees, lab access, and available resources. 
        Also reviewed HTML and CSS to refresh our understanding of basic web layout and styling. Then, we moved into a JavaScript + DOM review

        - Introduced to Python foundations and learned how to access and use web APIs. The focus was on understanding how Python can handle data communication between servers and clients.
        Worked with the World Air Quality Index API, practicing how to send API requests, interpret responses, and document the retrieved data.

      <h4>WEEK 3: September 22nd</h4>
      <article>
        - Exercise I, required making real API requests to the World Air Quality Index API. We subscribed to the API and received a token to authenticate our requests. 
        Then we broke down the documentation and learned how to structure URLs, replace placeholders, and evaluate the JSON structure in responses.
        Explored: Sending API calls with parameters, retrieving and printing responses, checking the variable type and keys, iterating through the returned data, 
        extracting station names, geolocations, AQI values, and pollutant IDs

      <h4>WEEKS 4–8: September 29 to October 27</h4>
      <article> - These weeks moved fully into Flask, starting with basic routing and eventually building full dynamic web pages.
      Learned how to set up: Flask applications, routes, debug mode, template rendering. We then moved into Jinja template inheritance, 
        creating a base template with a header/nav/footer and extending it through multiple child templates. We practiced passing Python variables into HTML, 
        looping through data, adding conditional statements, and using url_for().

      <article>
        - Exercise II, required setting up routes /t1 and /t2, creating templates that inherit from base.html, building a Jinja-powered page combining variables, 
        loops, images, and conditional elements, and making an HTML form that sends GET data to the server. Had to implement processing for the user’s input to creatively output a 
        transformed string. We learned the structure of multi-page websites and how server logic connects to visual design.

      <h4>WEEKS 9-11: November 3rd-17th</h4>
      <article>
        - These were the most technical and demanding weeks so far.
        Connected client-side JavaScript to Flask using fetch(). Built interactive pages that collect data, handel sending POST requests with JSON data, and recieving JSON responses. This helped with 
        updating pages dynamically. 
      </article>
      <article>
        - Exercise III, required combining all the concepts: Designing a creative HTML page with user interaction, capturing data with JavaScript, sending it to the server via fetch() (POST),
        saving the data to files/data.txt server-side, sending back a JSON confirmation, and displaying the message visually on the client
        The exercise addressed: front-end collection, back-end processing, persistent storage, and dynamic feedback to user.
